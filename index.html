                    I'd like to be successful in anything I'll be doing in the future, since it would
                    lead to a peaceful and calm life

                <p>As long as I'm away from problems and living my life in

            <h2>Dracula</h2>

            <div>
                <p>"Then he began to whisper: 'Rats, rats, rats! Hundreds, thousands, millions of them, and every one a
                    life; and dogs to eat them, and cats too. All lives! all red blood, with years of life in it; and
                    not merely buzzing flies!' I laughed at him, for I wanted to see what he could do. Then the dogs
                    howled, away beyond the dark trees in His house. He beckoned me to the window. I got up and looked
                    out, and He raised his hands, and seemed to call out without using any words. A dark mass spread
                    over the grass, coming on like the shape of a flame of fire; and then He moved the mist to the right
                    and left, and I could see that there were thousands of rats with their eyes blazing red--like His,
                    only smaller. He held up his hand, and they all stopped; and I thought he seemed to be saying: 'All
                    these lives will I give you, ay, and many more and greater, through countless ages, if you will fall
                    down and worship me!' And then a red cloud, like the colour of blood, seemed to close over my eyes;
                    and before I knew what I was doing, I found myself opening the sash and saying to Him: 'Come in,
                    Lord and Master!' The rats were all gone, but He slid into the room through the sash, though it was
                    only open an inch wide--just as the Moon herself has often come in through the tiniest crack and has
                    stood before me in all her size and splendour."</p>

                <p>His voice was weaker, so I moistened his lips with the brandy again, and he continued; but it seemed
                    as though his memory had gone on working in the interval for his story was further advanced. I was
                    about to call him back to the point, but Van Helsing whispered to me: "Let him go on. Do not
                    interrupt him; he cannot go back, and maybe could not proceed at all if once he lost the thread of
                    his thought." He proceeded:--</p>

                <p>"All day I waited to hear from him, but he did not send me anything, not even a blow-fly, and when
                    the moon got up I was pretty angry with him. When he slid in through the window, though it was shut,
                    and did not even knock, I got mad with him. He sneered at me, and his white face looked out of the
                    mist with his red eyes gleaming, and he went on as though he owned the whole place, and I was no
                    one. He didn't even smell the same as he went by me. I couldn't hold him. I thought that, somehow,
                    Mrs. Harker had come into the room."</p>

                <p>The two men sitting on the bed stood up and came over, standing behind him so that he could not see
                    them, but where they could hear better. They were both silent, but the Professor started and
                    quivered; his face, however, grew grimmer and sterner still. Renfield went on without noticing:--

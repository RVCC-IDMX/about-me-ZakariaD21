                <p>
                    I'd like to be successful in anything I'll be doing in the future, since it would
                    lead to a peaceful and calm life
                </p>
                <p>As long as I'm away from problems and living my life in
                    calm I'll be happy</p>
                <p>And OF COURSE I NEED VIDEOGAMES IN MY LIFE!</p>

            <h2>Dracula</h2>

            <div>
                <p>We then waited whilst Lucy made her toilet for the night, and when she was in bed he came and himself
                    fixed the wreath of garlic round her neck. The last words he said to her were:--</p>

                <p>"Take care you do not disturb it; and even if the room feel close, do not to-night open the window or
                    the door."</p>

                <p>"I promise," said Lucy, "and thank you both a thousand times for all your kindness to me! Oh, what
                    have I done to be blessed with such friends?"</p>

                <p>As we left the house in my fly, which was waiting, Van Helsing said:--</p>

                <p>"To-night I can sleep in peace, and sleep I want--two nights of travel, much reading in the day
                    between, and much anxiety on the day to follow, and a night to sit up, without to wink. To-morrow in
                    the morning early you call for me, and we come together to see our pretty miss, so much more strong
                    for my 'spell' which I have work. Ho! ho!"</p>

                <p>He seemed so confident that I, remembering my own confidence two nights before and with the baneful
                    result, felt awe and vague terror. It must have been my weakness that made me hesitate to tell it to
                    my friend, but I felt it all the more, like unshed tears. 12 September.--How good they all are to
                    me. I quite love that dear Dr. Van Helsing. I wonder why he was so anxious about these flowers. He
                    positively frightened me, he was so fierce. And yet he must have been right, for I feel comfort from
                    them already. Somehow, I do not dread being alone to-night, and I can go to sleep without fear. I
                    shall not mind any flapping outside the window. Oh, the terrible struggle that I have had against
                    sleep so often of late; the pain of the sleeplessness, or the pain of the fear of sleep, with such
                    unknown horrors as it has for me! How blessed are some people, whose lives have no fears, no dreads;
                    to whom sleep is a blessing that comes nightly, and brings nothing but sweet dreams. Well, here I am
                    to-night, hoping for sleep, and lying like Ophelia in the play, with "virgin crants and maiden
                    strewments." I never liked garlic before, but to-night it is delightful! There is peace in its
                    smell; I feel sleep coming already. Good-night, everybody. 13 September.--Called at the Berkeley and
                    found Van Helsing, as usual, up to time. The carriage ordered from the hotel was waiting. The
                    Professor took his bag, which he always brings with him now.</p>
